## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **User-tunable nudge thresholds (C30)**: context-switch nudges now read `nudge_thresholds` from `config.yaml` (default `[30, 50, 70]`) — users who want more headroom set e.g. `[35, 55, 75]`. SKILL.md documents the tuning knob; FAQ added to README (why nudged / how to change / handover ready / privacy).

### Changed
- **Storefront copy rewritten for scenario matching**: the ClawHub `description` (storefront summary) now opens with the capability + measured numbers and then lists 6 explicit "Use when" trigger scenarios, so an agent can match its current situation instead of reading ad copy; a Chinese trigger line (中文触发) is added for the same reason. Consumers stay separate — README top keeps the human-facing capability + numbers narrative, SKILL.md first screen carries the condensed use-when / key commands / cost. GitHub repo description cleared of the retired projection figure (measured ~70% / 55-75% only).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **Single-source script refactor (0.4.1 pending)**: `scripts/memory_index.py` build/summary templates are now language-driven via a built-in zh/en word table — the published default stays English (`lang` defaults to en when absent), so external behaviour is unchanged from 0.4.0. The top-level `lang: en|zh` config key selects the display language, and the maintainers' private/internal layout (agent names, local paths, Chinese descriptors) moved entirely into their own private config file. Published package carries zero private content.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Rules alignment (alignment layer)**: recovery now extracts the imperative rules from the user's rules files and restates them explicitly in the recovery report — the user sees that the do's and don'ts they set are loaded every session ("it remembered what I told it"). Honest "no hard rules found" when the rules file has none.
- **Action-time guardrail (enforcement layer)**: optional `scripts/rule_gate.py` reads `.evermind/rules.json` (written by the agent at recovery: id/text/keywords per rule) and blocks violating actions — `--check "description"` for scripts, or Claude Code PreToolUse JSON on stdin for hook wiring (example in SKILL.md). Exit 2 on a hit; pure stdlib; fails open (no rules file → pass); writes nothing.
- **Handover protocol**: say "handover" (交接/收尾) at any task break → agent writes `.evermind/handover.md` from `assets/handover-template.md` (✅ done · 📌 leftover · 🔗 pointers · ➡️ next). Recovery reads it if present as the fast pointer; authority stays with todos/journal.
- **Nudge upgrade (ready-signal hard rule)**: context checks now happen at every visible reading (usage jumps between turns — 29% one turn, 49% the next), with pre-nudge bands approaching each threshold (25–30 / 45–50 / 65–70) so a jump never passes in silence; and **any** nudge — pre or full — goes out only after `.evermind/handover.md` has been refreshed, so a user who switches right after a nudge loses nothing.

### Changed
- Storefront/SKILL.md copy adds "rule memory" and "one-line handover" to the value story; product positioning unchanged (memory first — rules are memory of the most important kind).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Environment discovery** (fixes the "assumes our file layout" flaw): `memory_index.py --discover`/`--list` locate the user's memory carriers by community conventions (rules/identity/todos/journal) → `.evermind/discovery.json`. Fresh installs work with zero config.
- **Semantic roles**: config `roles:` maps rules/identity/todos/journal/profile → real files (file or directory; directory resolves to newest `YYYY-MM-DD.*`); extras stay L3/L2.
- **Context gauge + threshold nudges**: per-platform context-usage query table (Hermes `/status`, Claude Code `/context`, …); honest reporting — never invent a percentage; 30/50/70% switch nudges.
- `--mode internal|auto|manual` (internal = fixed-layout for the maintainers' own vault; published/community default = auto).

### Changed
- Recovery is honest about sources: reports which files each role resolved to, and **lists empty roles instead of claiming a full recovery** (fixes silent false-recovery).
- Discovery cache is stat-validated before reuse — a moved/deleted source triggers re-discovery (never reuse stale paths).
- Legacy 0.2.x config (`must_read`/`tracked_files`) migrates automatically, preserving L3/L2 semantics (never upgrades L2 to per-session reads).
- Storefront description updated to the finalized token-saving narrative — "the token-saving switch… save tokens, save money, save worry", with the measured 44K→12K (~70%) recovery comparison (author-approved copy; replaces the earlier benefit-first wording).
- Security wording updated for the discovery layer (name-only scan, no content reads); README/config/SKILL.md synchronized; root `version` file corrected (was stale 0.1.1).

### Fixed
- config.example.yaml key mismatches (`note:` vs code's `desc:`; `index_output` vs `output_index`) resolved by full rewrite.
- yaml-less fallback silently dropped legacy 0.2.x configs (0-file empty index, rc0, no stderr) — fallback no longer pre-seeds empty extras (which made migration never run), legacy `must_read`/`tracked_files` migrate for real (7eddf32).
- Fallback parser could not parse the shipped nested `roles:` shape — no-yaml + manual roles produced a silent empty index while the YAML interpreter indexed 2+ files; fallback now parses nested roles (inline `[a,b]`, block list, empty subkey) and errors out loudly (rc3 + stderr) on declared-but-empty roles instead of writing a silent empty index (6f03ea6).
- Fallback kept literal YAML quotes on scalar values (`"CLAUDE.md"` → path with quotes → `read failed` rows with content dropped while stdout still said OK rc0) — diverging from the YAML interpreter for the same config. `_unquote()` now strips one matching quote pair on every fallback value path (roles inline/block items, flat `role_*` items, extra dict path/name/desc, mode, scalar keys); quoted configs parse identically under both interpreters (890a35e).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Positioning upgrade (user insight): headline benefit reframed as **free context switches** — cheap reliable recovery means users can switch sessions at any task boundary without losing state, instead of stretching one context until it breaks. README adds a "Why this changes your workflow" section; storefront description now leads with cross-session restore + switch-anytime + ~70% fewer tokens.
- README version badge corrected to 0.2.2 (was stale 0.1.1 through 0.2.0/0.2.1).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Storefront description rewritten benefit-first: "Never re-explain yourself to your AI..." (value hook → quantified savings → platform list), replacing the mechanism-first wording — clearer what users get in the first 3 seconds.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- L2 read policy split: index entries whose one-line description already answers the need (role cards / member summaries) now require only the **index summary line**, not a full-file read — full reads reserved for substantive docs.
- Single-source-of-truth note: index descriptions are display rows; authoritative role summaries live in the roles table (config/discovery); agents maintaining their own rules/identity files must log the change and refresh the table.

### Changed
- SKILL.md Usage step 2 & How-it-works L2 row updated to the split policy (previously "changed → read in full").
- Honest-numbers wording aligned to the measured 2026-09-04 range (~55-75% cumulative for host-injected identity; retired the 85%/6.5K projection phrasing).
- Install references updated to the final slug `evermind-ai-agent-memory` (old working titles removed).

### Fixed
- (none)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Renamed to **Evermind** (repo `evermind`; brand prefix dropped, low-key credit in README footer).
- README rewritten in English with per-platform install guide (Hermes / ClawHub / Claude Code / Cursor / generic SKILL.md agents).
- SKILL.md fully English; platform-support section added; frontmatter description extended (85%+ host-injection case).
- config.example.yaml comments and sample names in English.
- Script user-facing output (docstring, CLI messages, demo) localized to English.
- Chinese docs kept out of the published tree (archived locally).

### Added
- LICENSE file added (MIT-0).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Tiered progressive memory recovery (SKILL.md): L3 must-read / L2 conditional reads driven by a change index / L1 on-demand.
- Companion script `scripts/memory_index.py`: config-driven change-index generation, pure stdlib, hash-idempotent with a 24h freshness window.
- `config.example.yaml` template; README (pitch / how-it-works / install / safety / roadmap).
- Dual-compatible frontmatter (standard fields + Hermes `metadata.hermes`).
